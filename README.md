# Curved arcs
Gravitational lensing formalism in a curved arc basis.

This repository hosts the notebooks to reproduce the figures presented by Birrer 2021.


## Notebooks
The following notebooks are available:


- [Curved arc illustrations](https://github.com/sibirrer/curved_arcs): Notebook to illustrate curved arcs and 
constraints in azimuthal and radial direction.

- [SPT in curved arcs](https://github.com/sibirrer/curved_arcs): Notebook to assess shape noise degeneracies in 
the inference of curved arcs.

- [local vs global fit](https://github.com/sibirrer/curved_arcs): Notebook demonstrating the
joint fitting of local curved arc models without relying on a global macro model, and comparing the constraints
with the global macro-model inference.


## Dependencies

All the calculations and analysis are performed by [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy).
The notebooks in the form presented run with lenstronomy version 1.8.1.
